# What is {frontmatter.title} ? #

A productivity app provides you time tracking, task management, and time management.
Want to track your task? No problem. Want a Pomodoro? No problem.

# Why {frontmatter.title} ? #
We gathered ideas from *Get Things Done*, *Pomodoro*, and *Time Blocking*, trying to combine those methods into one app to prevent context switching and improve productivity.

# Features #

- Task Management
  - Create, Edit, Delete, and Complete tasks
- Pomodoro Timer
  - Start, Pause, and Stop the timer


# Page Structure #


> / => Landing Page (This page)
>
> /app => App Page (All the services)
>   - /app/?view=index => Allow user dump their task
>   - /app/?view=calendar => Calendar view
>
> /app/timer => Timer Page (Pomodoro Timer)
>   - /app/timer/?task=id => start timer within a task id
